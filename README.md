# Personal Portfolio (HTML + Tailwind + JS)

This is a minimal, responsive personal portfolio static template built with plain HTML, TailwindCSS (via CDN), and vanilla JavaScript. It's intended as a starting point for web developers.

Features
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Mobile menu toggle
- Dark mode toggle (client-side)
- Smooth internal link scrolling
- Simple client-side contact form stub

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `assets/js/main.js` — JS interactivity (menu, dark mode, form handling)

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit content (name, intro, projects, links).
3. Replace placeholder images and links with your own.

Customization
- Replace the Tailwind CDN with a compiled build if you need production performance and custom configuration.
- Hook the contact form to your backend or a service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a serverless endpoint.
